# CCpp-Programming!**

==================================================================
This repository is all about C and C++ programming.

To compile all the files, you can use the following command:

```bash
make all
```

or, if you want to compile all files under one directory, then type:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh               # make sure the script is executable
./build.sh Sorting_Techniques/  # This will build all the files under 'Sorting_Techniques' directory
```

Also, to run the program, you can use the following command:

```bash
chmod +x runner.sh                              # make sure the script is executable
./runner.sh Data_Structures/Trees/Binarytree.c  # This will run the file as given in the argument
```

Let's contribute to this repo!
